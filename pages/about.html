          <p>I started working as a Telecommunication Network Engineer more than 15 years ago and at that time I became interested in web development and web applications.</p>
          <p>Like many developers, I started creating plug-ins for WordPress and creating applications with the classic LAMP stack (Linux, Apache Server, MySQL, and PHP).</p>
          <p>In 2014 I became interested in web application development using JavaScript and libraries like JQuery and from then on I became passionate about developing with the ecosystem of JavaScript-related technologies, including libraries like React.js, React-Redux, Redux, React-Router and frameworks like Vue.js and Ember.js.</p>
          <p>Since then I have been working as a Front-End Freelancer Developer, and I have also worked for European companies, participating in projects for clients in America, and America.</p>
